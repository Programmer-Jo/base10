# base10
10 digit multiplication

I do a lot of math reasearch in number theory and most of my theories work, but I would hate to find that once I publish the 
calculations that there is an exception for one number. So what I usually did was use a calculator, until I got to massive numbers
then I would use a  computer, but that ook long to calculate all the possibilities, so I made Base10
Basically it takes one of two numbers that will be multiplied and breaks it down (There will be an example) The multiplies the 
seconde number to the broken down numbers and using addition you will get the answer.
Example:
1234 x 3456

1000 x 3456 = 3 456 000    
200 x 3456 = 691 200
30 x 3456 = 103 680
4 x 3456 = 13 824

 When you add all of them you will get: 4 264 704
 This is very basic because I only use ten digit numbers, hopefully I will be able to multiply hundred digit numbers together 
 and get an answer quickly insted of waiting.
 I hope to get this program to run on my raspberry pi and then at the end of the day check the results, meaning that I can multiply 
 extremely large numbers together on a raspberry pi instead of a supercomputer.
